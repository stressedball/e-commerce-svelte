# A svelte e-commerce app

I didn't succeed as I wanted in my previous to-do-list app.
Having to wire the app with supabase and the routes, was tougher as I'm not as proficient with stores.
React was a breeze for reference.

## Will be using an API to generate dummies

The work will be shortened and I'll be focused on writing the app.

### test the api

API used : https://dummyjson.com/.

From what I gathered, there are 100 products that exist in the API.

I was thinking about a way on caching the data but since the options are known, I decided to do it differently.

100 products is enough to make it 'variable' enough and introduce just enough variety so that it feels like a genuine shop.

### need a landing page

Will get 3-5-8-10 products and showcase them

### layout



### will have to make dynamic routing for each product and/or category

### a page for checking out

### a search functionality
